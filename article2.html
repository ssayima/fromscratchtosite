    <h1>How do you eat an elephant?</h1>
    <h3>And so it begins.
    </h3>
    <p>It’s so discouraging to start something new sometimes. It can feel like taking on Mount Everest or an impossible marathon. Like how am I ever gunna get to the top or finish the damn thing when I’ve never done it before?
    </p>
    <p>I’ve asked myself that question for about a year and now I’m all questioned out. I’ve worked myself to exhaustion by remaining anxious and frozen, I might as well give doing something a try.
    </p>
    <p>One of the things I’m going to start doing is setting up a 30 minutes timer, twice a day, to do a bit of freeCodeCamp. If I want to keep going after the 30 minutes are done(like it happened today) that’s well and good. And if I want to stop at the 30 minutes mark, equally amazing.
    </p>
    <p>I’ve just finished the HTML part, the next step is copying my articles from Medium to a self made HTML only website. I’m kinda excited. I’m not going to move onto CSS until my HTML site is deployed and ready.

    <p>How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.
