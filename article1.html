    <h1>I am going to start writing terribly from now on
    </h1>
    <h2>One might argue I already do, and to that I say “At least I was trying not to.”
    </h2>
    <p>It’s my first day of my new routine which includes writing an article every weekday(holidays and days that my partner is not working do not apply).
    </p>
    <p>So far so good. I got myself a pomodoro type alarm, it’s a mechanical egg timer which for some strange reason gives me a fine dose of dopamine every time it rings.
    </p>
    <p>I had an aha! moment last week when talking to my therapist about why I’ve never stuck to a routine before. I always took on too much and as a result I ended up feeling overwhelmed and did nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>That and also when I did manage to cut down some things to their bare minimum, like meditating at least for only 10 minutes a day for example, I would sometimes not do that either because a part of me is scared of being better…
    </p>
    <p>…take a load of that.
    </p>
    <p>When I can’t even sit to meditate for 10 minutes it’s because a part of me, an ill informed part of me, thinks it’s going to die if I stick to a healthy habit and so it does everything it can to keep me on the status quo.
    </p>
    <p>With those two insights I think I’ve come up with a routine that takes into account both ends of my personal self sabotage spectrum by sticking to the following;
    </p>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Focus on one or two things a day
        </li>
        <li>State the clear bare minimum task that you can do with no problem, that way when you do notice a resistance to it you automatically know it’s the ill informed tiny part of you that thinks it needs to save itself from oblivion when in reality all aspects of you are going to benefit from this new change.
        </li>
    </ol></p>
    <p></p>
